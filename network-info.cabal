synopsis:       Access the local computer's basic network configuration

description:    This library provides simple read-only access to the
                local computer's networking configuration. It is
                currently capable of getting a list of all the network
                interfaces and their respective IPv4, IPv6 and MAC
                addresses.
                .
                network-info has been tested and is known to work on
                Ubuntu 10.10, FreeBSD 9.0, Mac OS X 10.6.4 and Windows
                XP/7. It probably works on other flavours of Linux,
                OS X, FreeBSD and Windows as well.
